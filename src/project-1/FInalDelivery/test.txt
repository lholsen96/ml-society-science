TestLending_stripped.py: (needs 'german-manwoman.data')
	Calculates the relative counts and produce histograms of our policy's decisions.

TestLending_stripped2.py: (needs 'german.data')
	Makes a logistic model. Create two different test sets where we change the value of
	foreign_A202. Check the variation between what our policy decides in the two scenarios.

TestLending_stripped.py: (needs 'german-manwoman.data')
	Makes a logistic model. Calculates the relative counts and produce histograms 
	of our policy's decisions. Also makes two different testsets with gender switched.
	Check the variation between what our policy decides in the two scenarios.

TestLending3.py: (needs 'german.data')
	Calculate the utility given different epsilons (differential privacy)

NameBankerCVKNN.py
	Creates a KNN model by first doing a cross-validation to find the optimal k.

NameBanker.py
	A generic banker. We use it for the logistic model.

RandomBanker.py
	A banker that makes random decisions.
